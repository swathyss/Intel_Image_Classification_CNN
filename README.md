# 🧹 Data Preprocessing

Before training the CNN model, several preprocessing steps were applied:

### ✔ Image Resizing
All images were resized to **150 × 150 pixels** to maintain uniform input size.

### ✔ Pixel Normalization
Pixel values were scaled to the range **0–1** by dividing by 255.

### ✔ Train / Validation / Test Split
The dataset was split into:

- Training Set  
- Validation Set  
- Test Set  

### ✔ Data Augmentation

To improve model generalization and prevent overfitting, the following augmentation techniques were used:

- Image Rotation  
- Horizontal Flip  
- Zoom  
- Width & Height Shift  
- Shear Transform
